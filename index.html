		<h2>Banned Books Across the United States</h2>
		<p class="subhed"> A data analysis of PEN America's report of banned or restricted books across the United States.</p>
		<p class="byline">Reese Gaudelli</p>
		
		<p>A new analysis of PEN America's Index of School Book Bans  documents the instances where books were banned or restricted in school libraries throughout the United States.</p>
		<p>For my datawrapper chart, I created a bar graph showing the amount of book bans per state.  I thought it would be interesting to compare the amount of bans in a blue state like Vermont versus a red state like Texas. I chose light orange because I felt that it was pleasing to the eye, but it was still prominent enough to see the dramatic shift in states with a higher number of book bans. 

 </p>
		<p>For my creative dataviz, I created a map showing the amount of book bans that a particular author, Ellen Hopkins, has across the state. She is the most banned author in the country, and I wanted to portray that visually. Unfortunately, I am not an artist, so it didn't turn out the way I imagined in my head. If I could edit it, I would want each state to have a stack of books, representing the number of bans in that state. I would also want to include a visual element of Ellen Hopkins so that viewers can put a face to a name. Finally, I'd want my visualization to have a cleaner look overall.</p>
